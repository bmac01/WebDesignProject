                        <dl class="text-expand">
                            There are plenty of reasons to make learning a new language your new goal.
                            Research shows that language learning provides benefits such as boosting brain power and improving memory and can also make you more employable.
                            Not to mention, learning a language will introduce you to an exciting new culture!
                            <br><br>
                            <dt>Make a study plan</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    Your first step to learning a new language should be making a plan to study.
                                    Whether you try to do 10 minutes each morning before work or plan for a longer 30-minute or one-hour study session at the end of the day, make sure that you get your goals down on paper – you’ll be much more likely to stick to them!
                                    Get a planner to keep track of your study time or print a calendar to hang on your wall and you’ll be well on your way to picking up a new language.
                                <br><br></dd>
                            <dt>Practice every day</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    While a common misconception is that we don’t have time in the day for language learning, it’s always possible to find time!
                                    Try to practice every day, whether that’s reading a foreign-language newspaper each morning or listening to music in your chosen language as you work.
                                    If you’re learning with the help of an app like Duolingo or Lingodeer, you can also get notifications reminding you to practice every day at the same time!
                                    Making language learning a habit is the perfect way to make fast progress.

                            <dt>Focus on all four language skills</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    When it comes to learning a language, all four of the main skills are equally important: listening, reading, speaking, and writing.
                                    It can be easy to neglect speaking or writing in favour of watching a YouTube video or reading an example text in your chosen language, but make sure that you spend time concentrating on all of these skills.
                                    Try writing a journal entry at the end of each week summarising what you did, or read foreign-language texts aloud instead of in your head..
                                <br><br></dd>
                            <dt>Have real conversations</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    If you want to make speedier progress with your language, the best way to do it is to chat with others.
                                    While it might not be possible to meet a language-learning group in your local area, there are plenty of online meet-ups where you can chat with native speakers or other learners.
                                    This way, you’ll get valuable pronunciation practice, as well as learning new words.
                                <br><br></dd>
                            <dt>Immerse yourself</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    If you’re committed to language learning, make sure you’re seeing and hearing the language every day.
                                    There are a few simple ways to do this: put post-it notes on objects around your house with vocab translations and test yourself as you go about your day, or put subtitles on your favourite shows so that even when you’re not studying, you’re still seeing new words.
                                <br><br></dd>
                            <dt>Learn on-the-go</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    A busy lifestyle is no excuse to stop learning a language!
                                    Take advantage of all the time in your day, even if you’re travelling to work or university.
                                    Carry flashcards around so you can remind yourself of tricky vocab on-the-go, or try a podcast to improve your listening skills.
                                <br><br></dd>
                            <dt>Challenge yourself</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    As with any new skill, it can be hard to stay motivated through your language-learning journey.
                                    It’s important to set attainable goals, but try to challenge yourself to reach that next level, whether that’s watching a whole episode of a foreign-language TV show without subtitles or gaining certification.
                                    However you choose to learn a language, these tips will help you make the most of your study time.
                                    If you want to take your skills to the next level, consider a language study holiday, where you’ll learn from native speakers and get to immerse yourself in a new culture!

                    <dl class="text-expand">
                        Making mistakes is inevitable when you’re learning a new language.
                        After all, you’re learning complex grammar rules.
                        Students often make the same French grammar mistakes over and over again.
                        Being aware of these common grammar mistakes will help you avoid them in the future.

                                In English, when you greet someone in the early morning hours, you typically say “Good morning.”
                                This English greeting doesn’t translate literally in French.
                                In fact, the phrase <i>“Bon matin”</i> does not actually exist in the French language. Rather, one would simply say <i>“Bonjour!”</i> when greeting someone.

                                Remember to make adjectives properly agree with feminine or plural nouns.
                                For example, the adjective <i>“amusant“</i> (funny) would be changed to <i>“amusante”</i> in the feminine singular and <i>“amusantes"</i> in the feminine plural.
                                <br><br>In English, adjectives don’t usually change based on the gender or number, so it’s easy for students to forget this important French grammar rule.

                            <br><dd>
                                Remember to use the correct preposition and include the appropriate article contraction when necessary.
                                In theory, French prepositions are easier than English prepositions because there are fewer of the most common ones.
                                <br><br>For example, <i>“De”</i> translates to “of” or “from”, and <i>“à”</i> translates to “to,” “at,” and sometimes other related location or movement prepositions.
                                <br><br>A few places to watch out are when you’re talking about playing musical instruments <i>(Je joue d’un instrument)</i> and sports <i>(Je joue à un sport)</i>.
                                <br><br>Also, be extra careful with those pesky articles! Relevant contractions include <i>“du” (“de” + “le”), “des” (“de” + “les”), “au” (“à” + “le”)</i> and <i>“aux” (“à” + “les”). “De”, “la”</i>, and <i>“à la” do not contract</i>.
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Negative Articles</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                Use <i>“il n’y a pas de”</i> rather than <i>“il y a pas de”</i>.
                                When using <i>“de”</i> or <i>“de”</i> + an article in the negative, remember that French has lots of exceptions! This is one of them.
                                <br><br>If there is zero of something, take out the article. For example, someone could say <i>“Il y a du pain sur la table”</i> (There is bread on the table).
                                In the negative, this would become <i>“Il n’y a pas de pain sur la table”</i> not <i>“Il n’y a pas du pain sur la table”</i>.

                                Remember to conjugate your verbs. While we do this in the English language, it’s not as much or in as much detail as French-speakers.
                                <br><br>This is especially important when you’re writing because all those silent final consonants and vowels need attention.
                                <br><br>The singular forms are the most similar in present tense, but are not always spelled the same, so watch out!

                                The subjunctive is one of the most difficult verbs in French, if not the most difficult because we don’t use it often in English. Many of us anglophones aren’t even aware of the fact that we use it at all.
                                <br><br>The first step is to understand the situations in which it is used, and then practice, observe, and correct oneself. Then practice some more, and observe some more, and correct oneself more.
                                <br><br>Give yourself time to perfect this French grammar rule, but also insist on understanding and using it correctly. Gradually, you will be able to use it successfully.

                                    French people love talking about politics, even teenagers.
                                    You’ll witness people getting into animated debates about politics but still remaining close friends afterward.
                                    During conversations or debates, it is common in French culture for people to give their own perspective or interrupt the speaker to share their own anecdotes.
                                    This is not viewed as rude or impolite. French people also often take part in protests <i>(les manif)</i> and there are hundreds organized all year long to show dissatisfaction or express demands.
                                    <br><br>When greeting each other, French people kiss on the cheeks <i>(faire la bise)</i> to say hello, but only in certain situations with friends and family members.
                                    Two men might do so or only shake hands. In French culture, people do not kiss others who have not been presented as a close relative or acquaintance of one’s family.

                                    French people like to laugh and joke with everybody.
                                    Showing feelings, expressing satisfaction and gratitude are customary in French culture.
                                    It is typical in French families for family members to talk about themselves and ask for advice.
                                    Dinner time is a very important family gathering in French culture.
                                    It is often the occasion for all family members to share about their day and discuss the news.
                                    <br><br>French parents monitor their child’s social life and school results.
                                    Children are often required to ask permission to go out and to say where they are going, with whom and to respect a curfew.

                                    Because schools place a heavy emphasis on academics, few extracurricular activities are offered during the week.
                                    However, limited sports and drama opportunities are available.
                                    Soccer and Rugby are popular. French teens, like most teens, enjoy socializing by going to the movies or getting together at each other’s homes or in local cafés.
                                    Soccer and basketball are common hobbies for French teenagers.

                                    Food is very important to the French culture.
                                    When they are not eating, they enjoy talking about food, which is delicious and prepared with great care.
                                    French enjoy a wide variety of cheeses, as well as local specialties like foie gras (liver paté), escargots de Bourgogne (snails), crêpes, and cassoulet.
                                    French pastries and cheeses are also famous around the world.
                                    <br><br>In French culture, there are three main meals: breakfast is the smallest meal of the day and consists of coffee, tea, or hot chocolate with toast, butter, marmalade, and sometimes cereal.
                                    A very light meal, the goûter is very often available after school for children.
                                    It’s made of bread, butter, chocolate and juice.
                                    Dinner is the most important meal. The whole family eats and socializes together, between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.
                                    Lunch and dinner are warm meals and consist of three or four dishes served one after another: first course (soup or salad), main course (meat or fish and vegetables), cheese and/or dessert.
                                    <br><br>The French observe certain table manners such as not helping yourself before having been invited to do so, not leaving the table before the end of the meal, and helping to clear the table and wash the dishes.

                    <dl class="text-expand">
                        French Slang is always evolving.
                        Even people who have studied French for years occasionally suffer the embarrassment of being responded to in English by French people who are quick to pick up their accent.
                        If you want to really fit in, it is necessary to learn French <i>argot</i> (slang), of which there is plenty!
                        <br><br>
                        <dt>Chanmé/e</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                Many modern French slang words come from other words having been inverted.
                                This rings true here with <i>chanmé</i>, which came from <i>méchant</i>, meaning badly behaved or "wicked" and ordinarily used to describe a child.
                                You will hear Parisians using it to mean "wicked" in the modernised, positive sense of the word.
                                This is an easy one to slip into conversation without sounding too forced.
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Chiant/e</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                This can be used in numerous ways, but it certainly is not a pleasant word.
                                It is basically used to describe anything that is a pain in the ass, be that a person or a situation.
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Bouffer</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                This verb can be used to mean "to eat", but more in the sense of "to scarf".
                                With all the culinary delights of France, this word is sure to be useful! ("La bouffe" can also be used as a noun to mean "food".)
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Oklm</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                This phonetic acronym of the phrase au calme was made popular by French rapper Booba with his 2014 single.
                                It is used by young people to describe something that is "cool" or "chilled", in the "hip" sense of the word.
                                If you start following French people on Instagram, you will start to see it crop up more and more in captions.
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Laisse tomber</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                This expression roughly translates to "let it go", or "just forget it".
                                It is not a particularly aggressive phrase and is used in unimportant situations.
                                For example, if you were struggling to understand someone and they had already repeated themselves numerous times, they may eventually tell you to <i>laisse tomber</i>.
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Avoir le seum</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                This is a way to express that you are unhappy about something or, perhaps more accurately, "pissed" about something.
                                This is true Parisian slang, and you will definitely impress people by dropping this into conversation.
                                Most people of older generations will not have even heard of this expression.
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Mec</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                Translates to "guy" in a general sense, as a more casual way of describing a man, but is also commonly used to describe a boyfriend.
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Une clope</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                The French are known for being a nation of smokers, so it likely that at some point during your stay, you may be asked if you have a spare <i>clope</i>, which is the slang word for a cigarette.
                                The equivalent for us might be "a smoke" or "a cig".
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Mytho</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                Another insult that you may hear thrown about more often than you might think, <i>mytho</i> is an abbreviation of <i>mythomana</i>, literally meaning "a compulsive liar", commonly used to describe someone who has been known to exaggerate the truth, often with the intent to make himself sound better.
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Wesh</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                <i>Wesh</i>, or <i>wech</i>, is a slang greeting, used by most young people in an ironic way.
                                It comes from the <i>banlieues</i> (suburbs) of Paris and originally came from rappers, who used the term to greet their "crew".
                                If you say this to a group of French people, you may well be laughed at, but it is certainly usable in texts or Facebook messages, in the same way we use "yo".
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Frais/fraîche</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                This is used exactly the same was as it is in English.
                                Literally, <i>frais</i> means "fresh" and will be used to describe food, but the younger generation also uses it to describe things that they deem "cool".
                                Certain people you will hear using it completely seriously, while others now use it with a little more irony, just like in English.
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Kiffer</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                A great, easy verb to throw into everyday conversation and a good way to pay someone a compliment, <i>kiffer</i> is another way of expressing that you like something, in a much less formal way.
                                Using this would be like saying that you "dig" something.
                                Occasionally replacing <i>aimer</i> with <i>kiffer</i> will be sure to make you sound like a local among young people.
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Frérot</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                As mentioned in a previous example, <i>frérot</i> literally means "little brother", but it is used as we would use "bro" and not restricted to biological brothers.
                                It is usually used affectionately among friends, but can be heard between "cool young men" on the street.
                                You may consider using with a hint of irony, particularly as a non-native French speaker!
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Bosser</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                This is an informal version of the verb "to work", i.e. <i>travailler</i>.
                                Of course, you would not use it in conversation with your boss, but certainly among friends; it makes your French sound very authentic.
