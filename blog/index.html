                        <dl class="text-expand">
                            There are plenty of reasons to make learning a new language your new goal.
                            Research shows that language learning provides benefits such as boosting brain power and improving memory and can also make you more employable.
                            Not to mention, learning a language will introduce you to an exciting new culture!
                            <br><br>
                            <dt>Make a study plan</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    Your first step to learning a new language should be making a plan to study.
                                    Whether you try to do 10 minutes each morning before work or plan for a longer 30-minute or one-hour study session at the end of the day, make sure that you get your goals down on paper – you’ll be much more likely to stick to them!
                                    Get a planner to keep track of your study time or print a calendar to hang on your wall and you’ll be well on your way to picking up a new language.
                                <br><br></dd>
                            <dt>Practice every day</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    While a common misconception is that we don’t have time in the day for language learning, it’s always possible to find time!
                                    Try to practice every day, whether that’s reading a foreign-language newspaper each morning or listening to music in your chosen language as you work.
                                    If you’re learning with the help of an app like Duolingo or Lingodeer, you can also get notifications reminding you to practice every day at the same time!
                                    Making language learning a habit is the perfect way to make fast progress.

                            <dt>Focus on all four language skills</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    When it comes to learning a language, all four of the main skills are equally important: listening, reading, speaking, and writing.
                                    It can be easy to neglect speaking or writing in favour of watching a YouTube video or reading an example text in your chosen language, but make sure that you spend time concentrating on all of these skills.
                                    Try writing a journal entry at the end of each week summarising what you did, or read foreign-language texts aloud instead of in your head..
                                <br><br></dd>
                            <dt>Have real conversations</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    If you want to make speedier progress with your language, the best way to do it is to chat with others.
                                    While it might not be possible to meet a language-learning group in your local area, there are plenty of online meet-ups where you can chat with native speakers or other learners.
                                    This way, you’ll get valuable pronunciation practice, as well as learning new words.
                                <br><br></dd>
                            <dt>Immerse yourself</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    If you’re committed to language learning, make sure you’re seeing and hearing the language every day.
                                    There are a few simple ways to do this: put post-it notes on objects around your house with vocab translations and test yourself as you go about your day, or put subtitles on your favourite shows so that even when you’re not studying, you’re still seeing new words.
                                <br><br></dd>
                            <dt>Learn on-the-go</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    A busy lifestyle is no excuse to stop learning a language!
                                    Take advantage of all the time in your day, even if you’re travelling to work or university.
                                    Carry flashcards around so you can remind yourself of tricky vocab on-the-go, or try a podcast to improve your listening skills.
                                <br><br></dd>
                            <dt>Challenge yourself</dt>
                                <br><dd>
                                    As with any new skill, it can be hard to stay motivated through your language-learning journey.
                                    It’s important to set attainable goals, but try to challenge yourself to reach that next level, whether that’s watching a whole episode of a foreign-language TV show without subtitles or gaining certification.
                                    However you choose to learn a language, these tips will help you make the most of your study time.
                                    If you want to take your skills to the next level, consider a language study holiday, where you’ll learn from native speakers and get to immerse yourself in a new culture!

                    <dl class="text-expand">
                        Making mistakes is inevitable when you’re learning a new language.
                        After all, you’re learning complex grammar rules.
                        Students often make the same French grammar mistakes over and over again.
                        Being aware of these common grammar mistakes will help you avoid them in the future.

                                In English, when you greet someone in the early morning hours, you typically say “Good morning.”
                                This English greeting doesn’t translate literally in French.
                                In fact, the phrase <i>“Bon matin”</i> does not actually exist in the French language. Rather, one would simply say <i>“Bonjour!”</i> when greeting someone.

                                Remember to make adjectives properly agree with feminine or plural nouns.
                                For example, the adjective <i>“amusant“</i> (funny) would be changed to <i>“amusante”</i> in the feminine singular and <i>“amusantes"</i> in the feminine plural.
                                <br><br>In English, adjectives don’t usually change based on the gender or number, so it’s easy for students to forget this important French grammar rule.

                            <br><dd>
                                Remember to use the correct preposition and include the appropriate article contraction when necessary.
                                In theory, French prepositions are easier than English prepositions because there are fewer of the most common ones.
                                <br><br>For example, <i>“De”</i> translates to “of” or “from”, and <i>“à”</i> translates to “to,” “at,” and sometimes other related location or movement prepositions.
                                <br><br>A few places to watch out are when you’re talking about playing musical instruments <i>(Je joue d’un instrument)</i> and sports <i>(Je joue à un sport)</i>.
                                <br><br>Also, be extra careful with those pesky articles! Relevant contractions include <i>“du” (“de” + “le”), “des” (“de” + “les”), “au” (“à” + “le”)</i> and <i>“aux” (“à” + “les”). “De”, “la”</i>, and <i>“à la” do not contract</i>.
                            <br><br></dd>
                        <dt>Negative Articles</dt>
                            <br><dd>
                                Use <i>“il n’y a pas de”</i> rather than <i>“il y a pas de”</i>.
                                When using <i>“de”</i> or <i>“de”</i> + an article in the negative, remember that French has lots of exceptions! This is one of them.
                                <br><br>If there is zero of something, take out the article. For example, someone could say <i>“Il y a du pain sur la table”</i> (There is bread on the table).
                                In the negative, this would become <i>“Il n’y a pas de pain sur la table”</i> not <i>“Il n’y a pas du pain sur la table”</i>.
                            <br><br></dd>

                                Remember to conjugate your verbs. While we do this in the English language, it’s not as much or in as much detail as French-speakers.
                                <br><br>This is especially important when you’re writing because all those silent final consonants and vowels need attention.
                                <br><br>The singular forms are the most similar in present tense, but are not always spelled the same, so watch out!

                                The subjunctive is one of the most difficult verbs in French, if not the most difficult because we don’t use it often in English. Many of us anglophones aren’t even aware of the fact that we use it at all.
                                <br><br>The first step is to understand the situations in which it is used, and then practice, observe, and correct oneself. Then practice some more, and observe some more, and correct oneself more.
                                <br><br>Give yourself time to perfect this French grammar rule, but also insist on understanding and using it correctly. Gradually, you will be able to use it successfully.
